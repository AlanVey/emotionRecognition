The purpose of this tast was to gain hands-on experience in implementing and testing basic machine learning techniques. The techniques are Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR). Each of these techniques are used in order to identify six basic emotions from the human facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) based on a labelled set of facial Action Units (AUs). The latter correspond to contractions of human facial muscles, which underlie each and every facial expression, including facial expressions of the six basic emotions.
